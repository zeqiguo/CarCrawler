We gilded off the road. The transmission or torque converter was gone. There has been an ACURA Service bulletin 02-027 date 2/05/2008 on 2003 ACURA transmissions. ACURA has established a mileage and time limits on the warranty. I think a jury should review these limits as this can be a deadly situation. ACURA can either refund my money on the car or fix it.Update from Dec 15, 2017: Acura covered all but $500.00  along with a new torque converter, I got a new transmission.  I am very happy with the way Acura handle this.  My beautiful CL-S is running again.Update from Jan 20, 2018: Warranty didn\\'t do anything for me so I sent a letter to the head of ACURA and they replaced my transmission with me paying $500.00 and they paid $8100.00.  I am very happy with this result.  I love my 2003 CL-S, it is a wonderful car and ACURA did do the right thing; you just need to talk to the right person.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t- jerryc11,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSeabrook, US\\\\n\\\\n\", \"\\\\nI am a beyond frustrated owner of a 2003 Acura 3.2CL (S-Type). I bought this car in 2007 with less then 20,000 miles on it and felt great about the purchase since Acura/Honda has a reputation for dependable, long lasting, well made cars that hold their value. About 8 days ago on my way to work, I pressed the gas to accelerate into another lane and it was like I put my car in neutral. I pressed the gas pedal and my car just would not go but instead revved up to 7k RPM\\'s. I went from going 65mph to 45mph then down to less than 5mph in a matter of seconds. This all occurred in the middle lane of a major interstate during rush hour traffic. I have no idea how I managed to get across 3 lanes to the shoulder of the road without being rear ended. Cars were literally swerving in all directions to avoid hitting me. I got the car towed to a repair shop and was told that my transmission needed to be replaced and was quoted over $3000. I guess he could hear the disbelief in my voice and told me that I was the lucky owner of the make and model of Acura that had known transmission problems and told me to research it myself which I did for the next 3 days.. needless to say I am pissed off. Hundreds and thousands of people are in the same boat as I am. Acura told me that this was my problem and that there was nothing they could do as they have done to so many others. I now have the choice to buy a new car with no trade in because my freaking car is worth nothing at this point, or I can spend $3K on the car to replace the transmission. There may be no recourse for me in this really crappy situation but I will NEVER buy another Acura or Honda and will make sure that anyone and everyone that I know NEVER buys one either.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t- Jennifer C.,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tHendersonville, TN, US\\\\n\\\\n\", \\'\\\\nI owned hondas and acuras all my life after the wheel ripping off my honda accord and my kids being in my car, i was going to go with nissan. but i sat there and stood by honda and bought an acura cl. now after 2 trannys im screwed once again by honda. dont buy a honda. stay away. im going to the media with this bulls..it\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t- rivera2604,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tHartford, CT, US\\\\n\\\\n\\', \"\\\\nA D V E R T I S E M E N T S\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\'div-gpt-ad-1319716927473-6\\'); });\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\n I bought my 2003 Honda accord V6 3.2 L car no more than 8 months ago and it\\'s already having significant transmission problems. The first time it happened was about 2 weeks ago when heading home from work on I-96 when my car acted like it went into neutral then when I taped on the brake it down shifted. I pulled over and pushed on the gas and all it would do is rev up. I managed to get it to a Honda automotive service who told me it was just the 3rd gear pressure switch. I didn\\'t think that was exactly right since I had my father-in-law test it with his computer prior to taking it in and it came up as the torque converter clutch solenoid, but I went ahead and told them to do it if it would fix my problem. They did it, drove it off the lot, make it to the highway, get about 50 mph and the car did the same thing. Attempted to drive it back to the dealers and almost got rear ended by a semi. Now they\\'re telling me that I need to replace my transmission which will cost about $3,500 and they say they can\\'t reimburse me for the other unnecessary repairs.

Luckily, I was able to immediately access a shoulder to pull over. Drove car to Acura service on side road with flashers on - took nearly an hour to go 6 miles. Warning light finally came on a half mile from the dealership, although problem had happened several miles before and could easily have caused major accidents, based on driving situation. Acura service determined that transmission was defective and replaced it. Even though I later learned that the same model and year had been put under an extended warranty and was the subject of a class action lawsuit, I had never received any notifications. Further, I was told by Acura Corp and the dealership that my VIN number was not part of the problem/ lawsuit and I was required to pay for the new transmission, on the Acura with 60K miles that was in otherwise excellent condition..\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t- San Francisco, CA, USA\\\\n\\\\n\\', \"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTransmission in my 2003 Acura Cls had shifting problems.

After some research, I found out that there was a recall on the transmission and could lock up and cause an accident. At the time of the recall, the first owner did not have it replaced. The dealership replaced an engine cooler to help with friction. This obviously did not solve the problem. The engine is jerking and accelerating when I am trying to maintain a constant speed.

Honda agreed to replace some of these model year transmissions, but not all of them.
